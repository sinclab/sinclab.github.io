# site properties and page defaults
title: SINC LAB
subtitle: PI: Shawn A Rhoads, PhD
description: The SINC Lab examines the neural and computational basis of social cognition and interaction. We are particularly interested in how social interactions impact the well-being of self and others, and the contexts in which they can improve mental health outcomes. We use a combination of methods, including computational modeling of behavior, neuroimaging, and direct brain recordings.
