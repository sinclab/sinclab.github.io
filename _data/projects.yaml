  description: This project characterizes how and when computations along a cognitive hierarchy of social information processing (e.g., perception, learning, decision-making, higher-order belief inference) impact social connection and loneliness. This project is funded by an NIH Director's Early Independence Award ([1DP5OD037383](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10923384)).
