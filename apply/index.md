# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-sailboat" %}POST-DOCTORAL OPPORTUNITIES

The [**Computation and Decision-Making Lab**](https://codec-lab.github.io/) at New York University (PI: [Mark Ho](https://markkho.github.io/)) and [**Social Interaction and Neural Computation Lab**](https://sinclab.github.io/) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (PI: [Shawn Rhoads](https://shawnrhoads.github.io/)) are seeking a highly motivated and talented postdoctoral associate. The postdoc will be based at NYU and involved in collaborations across the two institutions. This is an exciting opportunity for individuals with a strong interest in computational models of social interaction (e.g., Bayesian theory of mind, multi-agent reinforcement learning) and how they can be applied to topics in computational psychiatry (e.g., social anxiety, paranoid/delusional ideation, loneliness).

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Lead cutting-edge research projects focused on developing novel computational techniques for analyzing behavioral and neural data from participants solving social dilemmas.
- Collaborate closely with the PIs and lab members.
- Conduct and publish high-impact research in top-tier journals and conferences.

**What We Offer:**
- Mentorship and professional development opportunities under the guidance of PIs (Mark Ho and Shawn Rhoads).
- Access to state-of-the-art research facilities and resources at NYU and Mount Sinai.
- A supportive network and a stimulating intellectual environment at NYU and Mount Sinai.

**Qualifications:**
- Ph.D. in Cognitive Science, Computer Science, Psychology, Neuroscience, or a related field.
- Strong background in computational cognitive modeling and statistics.
- Strong programming skills in JavaScript and Python for developing multi-participant, web-based experiments.
- Familiarity with experimental design for behavioral tasks and data collection from human participants.
- Demonstrated ability to lead research projects and work collaboratively.

Please apply with your CV, 2-4 references, and a cover letter describing (1) why you are interested in this position and (2) any relevant skills. Application review begins April 18, 2025, and will continue until the role is filled: https://apply.interfolio.com/165809

# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-sailboat" %}GRADUATE OPPORTUNITIES

There are several ways to join the lab as a graduate student. We are currently accepting students from the following programs:

- PhD in [Neuroscience](https://icahn.mssm.edu/education/phd/neuroscience/)
- PhD in Biomedical Sciences - [Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies in Medicine](https://icahn.mssm.edu/education/phd/biomedical-sciences/artificial-intelligence) (AIET) concentration
- Master of Science in [Biomedical Data Science and AI](https://icahn.mssm.edu/education/masters/data-science)

We also welcome <strong>visiting PhD students</strong> who are looking to supplement their training. Many programs encourage or allow students to spend time in a different lab to gain experience with new approaches and experimental paradigms. Our lab will consider visiting PhD students on a rolling basis for those able to commit at least 6-12 months, particularly trainees excited about computational models of social interactions and related research questions in the lab.

We also invite applications for volunteer <strong>Master's students</strong> positions. We are seeking motivated <strong>first-year Master's students enrolled full-time at a New York City institution</strong> who are passionate about understanding social connection and interaction. To apply, please complete [this application](https://forms.gle/ko77ZVKaL4UioeQn6)
