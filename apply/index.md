# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-sailboat" %}POST-DOCTORAL OPPORTUNITIES

Applications for the joint postdoctoral position on joint planning and computational psychiatry are now closed.

Please reach out if you are interested in other postdoctoral opportunities with the lab to work on projects related to **computational models of social interaction (e.g., Bayesian theory of mind, multi-agent reinforcement learning)** and how they can be applied to topics in **computational psychiatry (e.g., social anxiety, paranoid/delusional ideation, loneliness)**.

Interested applicants should have the following qualifications:
- Ph.D. in Cognitive Science, Computer Science, Psychology, Neuroscience, or a related field.
- Background/interest in computational cognitive modeling and statistics.
- Strong programming skills in JavaScript and Python for developing multi-participant, web-based experiments.
- Familiarity with experimental design for behavioral tasks and data collection from human participants.
- Demonstrated ability to successfuly lead research projects to completion and work collaboratively.

# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-sailboat" %}GRADUATE OPPORTUNITIES

There are several ways to join the lab as a graduate student. We are currently accepting students from the following programs:

- PhD in [Neuroscience](https://icahn.mssm.edu/education/phd/neuroscience/)
- PhD in Biomedical Sciences - [Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies in Medicine](https://icahn.mssm.edu/education/phd/biomedical-sciences/artificial-intelligence) (AIET) concentration
- Master of Science in [Biomedical Data Science and AI](https://icahn.mssm.edu/education/masters/data-science)

We also welcome <strong>visiting PhD students</strong> who are looking to supplement their training. Many programs encourage or allow students to spend time in a different lab to gain experience with new approaches and experimental paradigms. Our lab will consider visiting PhD students on a rolling basis for those able to commit at least 6-12 months, particularly trainees excited about computational models of social interactions and related research questions in the lab.

We also invite applications for volunteer <strong>Master's students</strong> positions. We are seeking motivated <strong>first-year Master's students enrolled full-time at a New York City institution</strong> who are passionate about understanding social connection and interaction. To apply, please complete [this application](https://forms.gle/ko77ZVKaL4UioeQn6)
