# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-sailboat" %}POST-DOCTORAL OPPORTUNITIES

The [**Computation and Decision-Making Lab**](https://codec-lab.github.io/) at New York University (PI: [Mark Ho](https://markkho.github.io/)) and [**Social Interaction and Neural Computation Lab**](https://sinclab.github.io/) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (PI: [Shawn Rhoads](https://shawnrhoads.github.io/)) are seeking a highly motivated and talented postdoctoral associate. The postdoc will be based at NYU and involved in collaborations across the two institutions. This is an exciting opportunity for individuals with a strong interest in computational models of social interaction (e.g., Bayesian theory of mind, multi-agent reinforcement learning) and how they can be applied to topics in computational psychiatry (e.g., social anxiety, paranoid/delusional ideation, loneliness).

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Lead cutting-edge research projects focused on developing novel computational techniques for analyzing behavioral and neural data from participants solving social dilemmas.
- Collaborate closely with the PIs and lab members.
- Conduct and publish high-impact research in top-tier journals and conferences.

**What We Offer:**
- Mentorship and professional development opportunities under the guidance of PIs (Mark Ho and Shawn Rhoads).
- Access to state-of-the-art research facilities and resources at NYU and Mount Sinai.
- A supportive network and a stimulating intellectual environment at NYU and Mount Sinai.

**Qualifications:**
- Ph.D. in Cognitive Science, Computer Science, Psychology, Neuroscience, or a related field.
- Strong background in computational cognitive modeling and statistics.
- Strong programming skills in JavaScript and Python for developing multi-participant, web-based experiments.
- Familiarity with experimental design for behavioral tasks and data collection from human participants.
- Demonstrated ability to lead research projects and work collaboratively.

Please apply with your CV, 2-4 references, and a cover letter describing (1) why you are interested in this position and (2) any relevant skills. Application review begins April 18, 2025, and will continue until the role is filled: https://apply.interfolio.com/165809
