 I am an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. I completed my Postdoctoral Research Fellowship with Dr. Xiaosi Gu within the Center for Computational Psychiatry. I earned my Ph.D. while working in the Laboratory on Social and Affective Neuroscience at Georgetown University under the mentorship of Dr. Abigail Marsh. I graduated from the University of Southern California with a Bachelor's Degree in physics and psychology.

I am also an avid social justice, environmental, and open science advocate. I have been involved with advocacy work for environmental sustainability and social justice on the local and national level. I strive to make science open, equitable, and accessible to all. 

Other selected grants, awards, and recognitions include:
● Lindau Nobel Laureate Young Scientist (2020, 2023)
● NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) Award (2018-2022)
● Harold N. Glassman Distinguished Dissertation Award (2024)
● At-Large Dr. Karen Gale Exceptional Ph.D. Student Award (2022)
● American Psychological Association Dissertation Research Award (2021)
● Mistletoe Research Fellowship (2020) 

 I am generally always open to collaborating on research projects relevant to my expertise and interests. I am also available for consulting, speaking engagements, and workshops on various research topics and methods, including but not limited to (1) computational modeling (e.g., reinforcement learning, model/algorithm development, model simulations, model fitting), (2) neuroimaging (e.g., task paradigm development in PsychoPy, BIDS, pre-processing, univariate analyses, multivariate analyses, model-based fMRI), (3) statistics, (4) machine learning, (5) programming in Python, and (6) open science practices aimed at making computational training in neuroscience more accessible.
