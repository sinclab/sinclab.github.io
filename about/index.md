# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-wrench" %}Vision

The <strong>SINC Laboratory</strong> research program has two primary goals. The first is to achieve a mechanistic understanding of the factors that improve or impair the well-being of the self and others across multiple levels of analysis (e.g., neurobiological, cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, societal). The second is to translate this understanding for direct application in medicine and policy.

We use a combination of methods—including computational modeling, functional neuroimaging, and intracranial recordings—to investigate the neural, cognitive, and computational processes underlying human social connection and interaction.

## Primary Research Questions

What neural and computational processes underlie individual differences in social perception, learning, and decision-making?

What drives variability and alignment in shared emotional experiences? How do we represent and understand others’ internal states (i.e., their emotions, beliefs, goals)?

How do prosocial and antisocial behaviors impact interpersonal relationships?

How does loneliness impact these processes and affect mental health?

Under what conditions do external social factors (e.g., context, community, broader societal structures) impact individuals' internal states, including their subjective well-being?
