# We examine the neural, cognitive, and computational basis of social connection and interaction

We are particularly interested in <strong>understanding how social interactions shape the well-being of self and others</strong> and the contexts in which they can improve mental health outcomes.

Our research program has two primary goals. The first is to achieve a mechanistic understanding of the factors that improve or impair the well-being of the self and others across multiple levels of analysis (e.g., neurobiological, cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, societal). The second is to translate this understanding for direct application in medicine and policy.

We use a combination of methods, including computational modeling, large-scale behavioral data collection, functional neuroimaging, and direct brain recordings, to understand how people connect with others, understand others, and value their welfare.
